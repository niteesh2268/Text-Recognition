Project Description
----------------------
The project has been divided into two major parts <br />

i)Text Detection: getting the bounding boxes in image <br />

    This part focuses on taking the images as input and outputting the coordinates of the region where text is present in the image. 
    The regions would contain a single word. 
    
ii)Text Recognition: extracting words from the bounding boxes <br />

    In this part we would extract the words from the regions that were identified by the text detection module.  
    The regions would contain a single word and this module would extract the word from that region.
